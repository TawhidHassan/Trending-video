## Getting Started

This project is developed using Flutter, adhering to the MVVM architecture pattern.
For state management, I have utilized the GetX library, providing a robust and efficient solution.
In future iterations, I plan to incorporate the Bloc pattern for enhanced state management capabilities.
Attached below are some project screenshots for your reference.
